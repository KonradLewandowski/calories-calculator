## Calories Calculator Application

Built with the use of modern technologies:
üí•JavaScript, üí•Node.js, üí•Express, üí•MongoDB, üí•Pug.js and more.
This is my first project that I created with the intention of understanding the relationship and connections between front-end and back-end.

Over the past few months by working on the project I got to know the environment of Node.js, learned how to manage databases, I got acquainted with issues related to the security of the server and databases and I know how front-end is connected to back-end.

While developing the project I made many mistakes which I corrected and drew conclusions from on a regular basis. Hundreds of hours of work have borne fruit in the form of creating secure authorization, protection from XSS attacks and prototype pollution and the implementation of CORS.

The calculator is a demo version that I created while simultaneously studying Node.js, JavaScript, Express, npm and other related libraries so the stability may sometimes leave much to be desired despite all of my efforts to make this application as complete as possible to the best of my abilities. I tried to create my code to be as clear and readable as possible.

I kindly ask you to try out the functionalities of the application:

1. The option to create a new user, log in and log out
2. Changing the password
3. Edition of user data
4. Resetting the password via a link sent by email with the use of Nodemailer library
5. Adding a new product to the database
6. Searching an existing product and adding it to a meal
7. Edition of the day dates
8. Edition of existing meals for the current day including the ‚Äúweight‚Äù value
9. Filtering displayed days from the chosen time range
10. Deleting an existing user
